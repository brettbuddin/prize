# Prize

Uses Twitter's streaming API to listen for specific keywords for a contest. It also tracks retweets of a specified user's tweets that contain those same search terms. This allows users to enter the contest by tweeting with, say, a hashtag and or by retweeting the originating organization's tweets containing said hashtag.
